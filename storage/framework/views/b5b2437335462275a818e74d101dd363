			<p style="text-align: left;">Choosing the right strain of medical cannabis can be confusing at first with so many different and occasionally unusual names – the strain names are not always representative of the desired medicinal effects. This being said, it is much easier to decide what your desired effects are before you decide which strain to go with. To make things easier we have split the effects into two categories: HEAD and BODY.</p>
<p>Most cannabis strains effect your<span style="color: #008000;"> HEAD</span> or brain within minutes after medicating. The effect either consists of a heavy and foggy feeling, or a clear and active feeling and can be classified on a scale of 1-7. with number 1 being heavy and foggy, and 7 being the clearest and most active . Head effects may start sooner than body effects, but tend to wear off quicker.</p>
<p>The <span style="color: #008000;">BODY </span>or physical effect usually creeps in about 5 to 15 minutes after the “head effect”. This effect can vary from being relaxing and sleepy, to being uplifting and energetic.  We can also apply the 1-7 scale to the “body effects”, with 1 being the most relaxing and 7 being the most uplifting.  Body effects usually take longer to set in but tend to last longer than head (mental) effects.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how to use our system. To simplify things we have made seven categories of the most common kinds of medicinal relief provided by cannabis: 1 being the heaviest Indica and 7 being the clearest Sativa. Depending on which category, or desired effect you wish to achieve, you can use the scale to find out which type of medicine you are looking for and suggested strains of that kind.</p>

</div>
<div class="well">

Type 7: An uplifting and clear effect without a physical side to it. This type of medicine is known as <span style="color: #008000;">Clear Sativa</span> and is recommended for patients who are looking for a Clear Head with little or no Physical effects that is easy to function on. Here are some examples of strains that have Clear Sativa attributes: Kali Mist, Strawberry Kush, Old Mother Sativa, Durban Poison, Jack Herer, Purple God and Power Plant.</p>
<p>One very important factor in choosing the right medicine for yourself is that each strain has a ceiling or limit to the amount and type of cannabiniods that can be received by your body at a certain time. This is why you gain a tolerance faster to certain strains and others seem to medicate the same way for longer. By choosing to use different strains, about three of four, that you can rely on, it is easier to keep your cannabiniod receptors fresh and ready to be activated by the next type of medicine you are using. This will help you conserve your medicine and get the maximum effect from it.  Having a few strains to medicate with can also help to reach the desired cannabiniod balance you are looking for.  It is also worth mentioning that accurately estimating cannabis effects must be treated with some subjectivity. Each patient has an individual reaction to each type of medicine tried, and experimentation with different types of strains is essential for the new patient.</p>
